# The Forgotten Bulgarian 

### üöß Still under construction üöß

> _"**–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤—£–Ω–∏—è—Ç –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏**" as is the original name of the project written in (old) Bulgarian_

is a mobile application for becoming familiar
with the Bulgarian language and culture as it is by guessing and learning authentic Bulgarian words that are rarely used nowadays. üáßüá¨

Made as a university project üéì (_with the intention to be a standalone mobile app in the future_).

# –ïtymology of the name
We Bulgarians, as holding the foundations of the Slavic script, are using the Cyrillic letters for our writing system. üìú

Back then, in older Bulgarian script there were several letters that had their proper usage and meaning (_although most Bulgarians even don't know about them_)

But unfortunately now are not used in our alphabet... (crying)



> // the proper usage of the "—è—Ç" (—£) letter

> // –ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç –∏ –ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤—è–Ω–∏—è—Ç

but there's one that shines the brightest of all.

### That is the letter `—£`,
called "**yat**" (direct translation of "_—è—Ç_" in Bulgarian) whoose main role was to unite the Eastern and Western dialect speech.

**That's why I used **`—£`** in "_–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤—£–Ω–∏—è—Ç_" because the Bulgarian language is almost forgotten (_–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤`–µ`–Ω–∏—è—Ç_) and is in constant state of oblivion (_–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤`—è`–Ω–∏—è—Ç_)**
