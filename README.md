# The Forgotten Bulgarian 

### 🚧 Still under construction 🚧

> _"**Забравѣният български**" as is the original name of the project written in (old) Bulgarian_

is a mobile application for becoming familiar
with the Bulgarian language and culture as it is by guessing and learning authentic Bulgarian words that are rarely used nowadays. 🇧🇬📱

Made as a university project 🎓 (_with the intention to be a standalone mobile app in the future_).

## Еtymology of the name
We Bulgarians, as holding the foundations of the Slavic script, are using the Cyrillic alphabet for our writing system. 📜

(_although most Bulgarians even don't know about that_)

Every one letter in the alphabet had its own special usage, power and meaning. <br>
But unfortunately there were several ones that have dropped out of our alphabet... (tears)

My idea was to remind Bulgarian people that our language is so beautiful and we have so many authentic and meaningful words that I had to use something that was considered "forgotten". I chose to make it with those "dropped-out" letters.

There were plenty of them, but there's one that shines the brightest of them all. ✨

### That is the letter `ѣ`,
called "**yat**" ("_ят_" in Bulgarian) whose main role was to unite the Eastern and Western dialect speech.

> Yes, in this small land of Bulgaria we have so many dialects that very often we don't understand each other. 😁

There is so much to write about our dialects but mainly Easterners tend to use the sound **\\e\\** (like in **e**at) more in words, whereas Westerners are mostly using the sound **\\ja\\** (like in **ya**cht).
> For example the word "**milk**" in literary Bulgarian is "**мляко**" and you will hear from Westerners saying it that way - "мл**я**ко".
> But if you go to Estern villages or towns in Bulgaria, you are probably going to hear people calling it "мл**е**ко". 🥛

Here is where **`ѣ`** comes in handy. By using the **`ѣ`** letter, both Easterners and Westerners are capable of reading and pronouncing the given word in their own way.

> Continuing with the "**milk**" example 🥛 - by just writing the word as "**млѣко**" you would allow Easterners to read and pronounce it "мл**е**ко" and Westerners - "мл**я**ко". Just freedom. 😄

**That's why I used **`ѣ`** in "_Забравѣният_" because the Bulgarian language is almost forgotten (_Забрав`е`ният_) and is in constant state of oblivion (_Забрав`я`ният_)**.
