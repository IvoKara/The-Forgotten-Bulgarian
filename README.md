# The Forgotten Bulgarian 

### üöß Still under construction üöß

> _"**–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤—£–Ω–∏—è—Ç –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏**" as is the original name of the project written in (old) Bulgarian_

is a mobile application for becoming familiar
with the Bulgarian language and culture as it is by guessing and learning authentic Bulgarian words that are rarely used nowadays. üáßüá¨üì±

Made as a university project üéì (_with the intention to be a standalone mobile app in the future_).

## –ïtymology of the name
We Bulgarians, as holding the foundations of the Slavic script, are using the Cyrillic letters for our writing system. üìú

Back then, in older Bulgarian script there were several letters that had their proper usage and meaning (_although most Bulgarians even don't know about them_)

But unfortunately now are not used in our alphabet... (crying)

but there's one that shines the brightest of all. ‚ú®

### That is the letter `—£`,
called "**yat**" ("_—è—Ç_" in Bulgarian) whose main role was to unite the Eastern and Western dialect speech.

> Yes, in this small land of Bulgaria we have so many dialects that very often we don't understand each other. üòÅ

There is so much to write about our dialects but mainly Easterners tend to use the sound **\\e\\** (like in **e**at) more in words, whereas Westerners are mostly using the sound **\\ja\\** (like in **ya**cht).
> For example the word "**milk**" in literary Bulgarian is "**–º–ª—è–∫–æ**" and you will hear from Westerners saying it that way - "–º–ª**—è**–∫–æ".
> But if you go to Estern villages or towns in Bulgaria, you are probably going to hear people calling it "–º–ª**–µ**–∫–æ". ü•õ

Here is where **`—£`** comes in handy. By writing using the **`—£`** letter, both Easterners and Westerners are capable of reading and pronouncing the given word in their own way.

**That's why I used **`—£`** in "_–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤—£–Ω–∏—è—Ç_" because the Bulgarian language is almost forgotten (_–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤`–µ`–Ω–∏—è—Ç_) and is in constant state of oblivion (_–ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–≤`—è`–Ω–∏—è—Ç_)**
