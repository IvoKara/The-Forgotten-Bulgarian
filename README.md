# The Forgotten Bulgarian 

### 🚧 Still under construction 🚧

> _"**Забравѣният български**" as is the original name of the project written in (old) Bulgarian_

is a mobile application for becoming familiar
with the Bulgarian language and culture as it is by guessing and learning authentic Bulgarian words that are rarely used nowadays. 🇧🇬

Made as a university project 🎓 (_with the intention to be a standalone mobile app in the future_).

# Еtymology of the name
We Bulgarians, as holding the foundations of the Slavic script, are using the Cyrillic letters for our writing system. 📜

Back then, in older Bulgarian script there were several letters that had their proper usage and meaning (_although most Bulgarians even don't know about them_)
> // the proper usage of the "ят" (ѣ) letter

> // Забравеният и Забравяният

there's one that shines the brightest of all

Literary Bulgarian

> we have so many dialects that very often we don't understand each other 😁
> млеко, мляко

dialect speech

**That's why I used **`ѣ`** in "_Забравѣният_" because the Bulgarian language is almost forgotten (_Забрав`е`ният_) and is in constant state of oblivion (_Забрав`я`ният_)**
