# The Forgotten Bulgarian 

### 🚧 Still under construction 🚧

> _"**Забравѣният български**" as is the original name of the project written in (old) Bulgarian_

is a mobile application for becoming familiar
with the Bulgarian language and culture as it is by guessing and learning authentic Bulgarian words that are rarely used nowadays. 🇧🇬📱

Made as a university project 🎓 (_with the intention to be a standalone mobile app in the future_).

## Еtymology of the name
We Bulgarians, as holding the foundations of the Slavic script, are using the Cyrillic alphabet for our writing system. 📜

Every one letter in the alphabet has its own special usage, power and meaning. <br>
But unfortunately, several ones have dropped out of our alphabet ... (tears)

My idea was to remind Bulgarian people (_most of whom don't know much about the above_) that our language is so beautiful and we have so many authentic and meaningful words 
that I had to use something considered as "forgotten". I decided to use those "dropped-out" letters to accomplish the task.

There were plenty of them to choose from, but one shines the brightest of them all. ✨

### That is the letter `ѣ`,
called "**yat**" ("_ят_" in Bulgarian) whose main role was to unite the Eastern and Western dialect speech.
> Yes, in this small land of Bulgaria we have so many dialects that very often we don't understand each other. 😁

There is so much to write about our dialects but mainly Easterners tend to use the sound **\\e\\** (like in s**e**t) more in words, whereas Westerners are mostly using the sound **\\ja\\** (like in **ya**cht).
> For example the word "**milk**" in literary Bulgarian is "**мляко**" and you will hear Westerners saying it that way - "мл**я**ко".
> But if you go to Eastern villages or towns in Bulgaria, you are probably going to hear people calling it "мл**е**ко". 🥛

Here  **`ѣ`** comes in handy. By using the **`ѣ`** letter, both Easterners and Westerners are capable of reading and pronouncing the given word in their own way.
> Continuing with the "**milk**" example 🥛 - by just writing the word as "**млѣко**" you would allow Easterners to read and pronounce it "мл**е**ко" and Westerners - "мл**я**ко". Just freedom. 😄

**That's why I used **`ѣ`** in "_Забравѣният_" because the Bulgarian language is almost forgotten (_Забрав`е`ният_) and is in constant state of oblivion (_Забрав`я`ният_)**. <br>
**I had to do something about it.**
